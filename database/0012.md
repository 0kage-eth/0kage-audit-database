## Issue

A non existent `id` can be passed to `close` function responsible to close a given loan against a credit line. Even though its a non-existent id, logic updates the state of `count` that keeps track of how many borrowings are done against that credit line. Repeatedly doing so for all loans opened against that credit line ultimately brings down `count` to 0 -> and this is used as a check to update the status of credit line to `repaid`.

```
// amount of open credit lines on a Line of Credit facility
uint256 private count;

// id -> credit line provided by a single Lender for a given token on a Line of Credit
mapping(bytes32 => Credit) public credits;

// @audit attacker calls close() with non-existent id
function close(bytes32 id) external payable override returns (bool) {
    // @audit doesn't check that id exists in credits, if it doesn't
    // exist an empty Credit with default values will be returned
    Credit memory credit = credits[id];

    address b = borrower; // gas savings
    // @audit borrower attacker will pass this check
    if(msg.sender != credit.lender && msg.sender != b) {
      revert CallerAccessDenied();
    }

    // ensure all money owed is accounted for. Accrue facility fee since prinicpal was paid off
    credit = _accrue(credit, id);
    uint256 facilityFee = credit.interestAccrued;
    if(facilityFee > 0) {
      // only allow repaying interest since they are skipping repayment queue.
      // If principal still owed, _close() MUST fail
      LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(credit.token, b, facilityFee);

      credit = _repay(credit, id, facilityFee);
    }

    // @audit _closed() called with empty credit, non-existent id
    _close(credit, id); // deleted; no need to save to storage

    return true;
}

function _close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id) internal virtual returns (bool) {
    if(credit.principal > 0) { revert CloseFailedWithPrincipal(); }

    // return the Lender's funds that are being repaid
    if (credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid > 0) {
        LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH(
            credit.token,
            credit.lender,
            credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid
        );
    }

    delete credits[id]; // gas refunds

    // remove from active list
    ids.removePosition(id);

    // @audit calling with non-existent id still decrements count, can
    // keep calling close() with non-existent id until count decremented to 0
    // and loan marked as repaid!
    unchecked { --count; }

    // If all credit lines are closed the the overall Line of Credit facility is declared 'repaid'.
    if (count == 0) { _updateStatus(LineLib.STATUS.REPAID); }

    emit CloseCreditPosition(id);

    return true;
}

```

## Impact

Current code allows a malicious borrower to theoretically manipulate the variable pool price & thus DOS the `priceLiquidity` function that prevents liquidations.

## Recommendation

Check the id before proceeding further.

## Learning

This is a case of unexpected empty inputs vulnerability - developer subconsciouly assumed that users will play fair and only pass and existing ID to this function. Such assumptions, as we see above, are clearly dangerous -> a random input should never get too far down the logic chain -> when we see inputs to a function, always fuzz the inputs and pass completely random ones. This is where fuzzing makes a lot of sense.

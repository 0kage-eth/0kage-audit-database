## Issue

Contract is missing a slippage check and passing minimum amount to return as 0, which necessarily means no slippage check. This exposes users to sandwich attacks

Intuitively, one uses the knowledge that someone’s going to buy an asset, and that this trade will increase its price, to make a profit. The attacker’s plan is to buy this asset cheap, let the victim buy at an increased price, and then sell the received amount again at a higher price afterwards.

Note the following in `veCVXStrategy::_swapcvxCRVToWant`

```
IUniswapRouterV2(SUSHI_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokens(
    toSwap,
    0, // @audit min. return of zero, no slippage check
    path,
    address(this),
    now
);
```

## Impact

Trades can take place at a worse price for users. In the above case, attackers profit is protocols loss

## Recommendation

Add minimum return amount checks.
Accept a function parameter that can be chosen by the transaction sender, then check that the actually received amount is above this parameter.

## Learning

This would have been caught by invariants -> if user has N liens totaling $M, and if repayment of $N is made where $M > $N, then total outstanding across all liens should ne $M-$N. This could have caught this issue in invariants test

When system supports multiple loans that can be repaid in one txn, always check - order in which loans are repaid, and why such order exists - if the sum total of repaid is euqal to the reduction in liabilities - if not, then there is an accounting inconsistency

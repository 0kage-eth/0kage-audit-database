Teller V2

## Issue

Every loan created in TellerV2 must have an associated collateral commitment from borrower. `commitCollateral` function allows a borrower to overwrite his existing commitment with 0 collateral amount. This way, a lender who has accepted borrower terms, has no security left because underlying collateral amount backing that loan is 0.

```
// AddressSet from https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable
// a loan must have at least one collateral
// & only one amount per token is permitted
struct CollateralInfo {
    EnumerableSetUpgradeable.AddressSet collateralAddresses;
    // token => amount
    mapping(address => uint) collateralInfo;
}

// loanId -> validated collateral info
mapping(uint => CollateralInfo) internal _loanCollaterals;

function commitCollateral(uint loanId, address token, uint amount) external {
    CollateralInfo storage collateral = _loanCollaterals[loanId];

    // @audit doesn't check return value of AddressSet.add()
    // returns false if not added because already exists in set
    collateral.collateralAddresses.add(token);

    // @audit after loan offer has been created & validated, borrower can call
    // commitCollateral(loanId, token, 0) to overwrite collateral record
    // with 0 amount for the same token. Any lender who accepts the loan offer
    // won't be protected if the borrower defaults since there's no collateral
    // to lose
    collateral.collateralInfo[token] = amount;
}

```

Note above that if borrower passes a same token with collateral amount 0, `collateral.collateralAddresses.add(token)` returns false instead of reverting. Since the inline result is unchecked, the `collateralInfo` of token is reset to 0. At this point, effectively loan becomes unsecured for borrower

## Impact

Lender ends up issuing a loan & then figuring out that there is no security against the loan. Unsecured loan would most likely result in borrower default causing loss of funds to lender

## Recommendation

Check the status of `add` and only allow changing value of collateral if its a new token. For existing token,

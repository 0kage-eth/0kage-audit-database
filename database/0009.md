## Protocol

Wild Credit

## Issue

`liquidate` function uses a Univ3 helper functions to `decreaseLiquidity`. When a user is trying to liquidate an undercollateralized loan using [`liquidate`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-wildcredit/blob/43cd6bfd22a11133177ed23f6f9642a6a26d3b26/contracts/LendingPair.sol#L294), sequence of operations is

`_unwrapUniPosition() -> uniV3Helper.removeLiquidity() -> positionManager.decreaseLiquidity()`

There is specific condition on which `decreaseLiquidity` reverts and that is if the `liquidity` of Univ3 position is 0. A malicious borrower can just create a UniV3 position with 0 liquidity and block any liquidation attemp.

Note the [UniV3 periphery contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L265) reverts when liquidity ==0

```
    function decreaseLiquidity(DecreaseLiquidityParams calldata params)
        external
        payable
        override
        isAuthorizedForToken(params.tokenId)
        checkDeadline(params.deadline)
        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
    {
        require(params.liquidity > 0); //@audit function reverts here
        Position storage position = _positions[params.tokenId];
        // ...
    }

```

## Impact

Undercollateralized loans will never be liquidated if the borrower account has a UniV3 position with liquidity =0

## Recommendation

Check if liquidity > 0 when removeLiquidity.

## Learning

Reviweing external contracts and their limitations is extremely important - edge cases that might trigger unexpected behavior from external protocols (Compound, Aave, UniV3, Curve etc) can trigger DOS or in worst case, loss of tokens.

Basic defi primitives and their limitations needs to be carefully reviewed when looking at a protocol that uses external platforms. Another related aspect is to check if the external contracts are `pausable` and analyze impact on our protocol if certain external functions revert in paused state.

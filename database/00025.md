## Protocol

BullVBear

## Issue

In the following example, an attacker can create a fake order whose expiry is in past (ie, `block.timestamp > order.expiry`).

Since its a random contract id, `!settledContracts[contractId]` and `!reclaimedContractsp[contractId]` are both true and all conditions in the fuinction pass.

Note that later,
` IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bull, bullAssetAmount);`

does not check if `bull` address is `address(0)` and simply transfers the amount to this address. By inserting a fake contractId, an attacker ensures that `bull` is a null addresss. In this scenario, the asset is simply transferred out to a null address and is permanently lost

```
    function reclaimContract(Order calldata order) public nonReentrant {
        bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);

        // ContractId
        uint contractId = uint(orderHash);

        address bull = bulls[contractId];

        // Check that the contract is expired
        require(block.timestamp > order.expiry, "NOT_EXPIRED_CONTRACT");

        // Check that the contract is not settled
        require(!settledContracts[contractId], "SETTLED_CONTRACT");

        // Check that the contract is not reclaimed
        require(!reclaimedContracts[contractId], "RECLAIMED_CONTRACT");

        uint bullAssetAmount = order.premium + order.collateral;
        if (bullAssetAmount > 0) {
            // Transfer payment tokens to the Bull
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bull, bullAssetAmount); //@audit amount here ends up transferred to a null address
        }

        reclaimedContracts[contractId] = true;

        emit ReclaimedContract(orderHash, order);
    }
```

## Impact

Protocol loses funds to null address

## Recommendation

Do a null transfeer check

## Learning

Whenever there is a transfer -> a good question to ask is, can the receiver be made a bnull address -> if receiever is picked of a mapping, a follow-up question is to ask if the mapping can be manipulated to throw a null address

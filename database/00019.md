## Protocol

Isomorph

## Issue

Governance can pause a collateral -> in that case, `collateralValid` is false. If this is the case, both repayment and liquidation of loans is disabled. in this case,

1. borrowers cannot repay and close out loans and stop incurring interest on that loan
2. liquidations are impossible causing a potential under collateralization and in the worst case insolvency of protocol

```
function pauseCollateralType(
    address _collateralAddress,
    bytes32 _currencyKey
    ) external collateralExists(_collateralAddress) onlyAdmin {
    require(_collateralAddress != address(0)); //this should get caught by the collateralExists check but just to be careful
    //checks two inputs to help prevent input mistakes
    require( _currencyKey == collateralProps[_collateralAddress].currencyKey, "Mismatched data");
    collateralValid[_collateralAddress] = false; //@audit this prevents any kind of repayment and liquidation
    collateralPaused[_collateralAddress] = true;
}
```

Note above that pausing collateral sets the `collatealValid` to false -> in that cause, there is no way a user can repay or liquidate a current loan

## Recommendation

Allow liquidations and loan closure when collateral is paused

## Learning

This is a important lesson in the impact of `pausable` contracts - if pausability causes excessive restriction on protocol functionality, it may lead to negative side effects.

If there are pausable contracts or pausable states, always think about scenarios and outcomes when such pausing is active

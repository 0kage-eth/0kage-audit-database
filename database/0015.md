## Protocol

Astaria

## Issue

`_deleteLienPosition` is wrongly given a `public` visibility -> this function handles a crucial operation of deleting a lien data from array associated with given `collateralId`. Although lien data still exists, the lien array that corresponds to `collateralId` is changed -> this would mean that the `CollateralToken.sol#releaseCheck` function that checks if collateral has liens against it is compromised.

```
function _deleteLienPosition(uint256 collateralId, uint256 position) public {
  uint256[] storage stack = liens[collateralId];
  require(position < stack.length, "index out of bounds");

  emit RemoveLien(
    stack[position],
    lienData[stack[position]].collateralId,
    lienData[stack[position]].position
  );
  for (uint256 i = position; i < stack.length - 1; i++) {
    stack[i] = stack[i + 1];
  }
  stack.pop();
}
```

## Impact

Anyone can remove a lien causing a collateral to be freed up. Once freed, user can go and collect back their collateral. Protocol is undercollateralized leading to solvency risks

## Recommendation

Validate `_rewardProportion` to have a max of 1e18 (100%)

## Learning

While the access itself is 101 & fairly straightforward, note that without manual review, this error would have been difficult to catch using fuzzing or invariant tools.

While the protocol key pramaters still show correct lien data, there is a critical vulnerability here. Simple state checks or invariants that just track the number of liens/liens data would not have caught this error. A more nuanced check that checks the size of liens array mapped to collateral ID would have caught this issue.

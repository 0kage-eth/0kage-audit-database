## Protocol

Lyra

## Issue

Users cannot close their Lyra vault positions when price is stale or circuit breaker is tripped. This has a problem at 2 levels - interest is accruing on loans while there is no way to repay - if loan is exceeding liquidation threshold, borrowers have no way to pay back loan or add new collateral to avoid default

Every time a user interacts with the vault, following code gets triggered:

```
function _checkIfCollateralIsActive(bytes32 _currencyKey) internal view override {

         //Lyra LP tokens use their associated LiquidityPool to check if they're active
         ILiquidityPoolAvalon LiquidityPool = ILiquidityPoolAvalon(collateralBook.liquidityPoolOf(_currencyKey));
         bool isStale;
         uint circuitBreakerExpiry;
         //ignore first output as this is the token price and not needed yet.
         (, isStale, circuitBreakerExpiry) = LiquidityPool.getTokenPriceWithCheck();
         require( !(isStale), "Global Cache Stale, can't trade"); //@audit reverts if the price is stale
         require(circuitBreakerExpiry < block.timestamp, "Lyra Circuit Breakers active, can't trade"); //@audit also prevents inteaction when circuit break is active
}
```

Note above that vault positions are not subject to change when either the price is stale or when circuit breakers are active.

## Impact

In both cases borrowers lose out by not having an ability to repay or add to their existing collateral

## Recommendation

Adding checks where all vault actions are suspended is overly restrictive. Regardless of circuit breaks or price staleness, 2 actions should always be allowed to preserve fairness to borrowers

- Ability to repay outstanding debt (independent of price and active circuit breakers)
- Ability to add collateral without taking any new debt positions (again, this is independent of the price action)

In both situations, there is no risk to the protocol but such a design will prevent losses to borrowers closer to liquidation

## Learning

In this example, 0x52 thought about the design aspects of the protocol - this error is not specific to any specific code error but looks at the design principles & potential loss scenarios for borrowers. This is a very good qualitative input to the developers who might ignore some edge case scenarios.

Always get an intuitive feel to the protocol - figure out what are edge cases, what happens if such an edge case happens, who loses and what might be possible mitigation

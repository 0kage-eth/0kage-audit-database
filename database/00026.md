Union finance

## Issue

Inorder to repay borrowing, user would call `UToken::repayBorrow` which inturn calls `UToken::_repayBorrowFresh`

```
    function repayBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount);
    }
```

In `_repayBorrowFresh`, if loan is overdue, `updateFrozenInfo` gets called but the `UToken` contract does not have necessary access to this function -> notice the modifier `onlyComptroller` exists for the `UserManager::updateFrozenInfo`

```solidity
       if (isOverdue) {
                // For borrowers that are paying back overdue balances we need to update their
                // frozen balance and the global total frozen balance on the UserManager
                IUserManager(userManager).updateFrozenInfo(borrower, 0);
            }
```

```solidity
   function updateFrozenInfo(address staker, uint256 pastBlocks) external onlyComptroller returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return _updateFrozen(staker, pastBlocks);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L305-L308

```
    modifier onlyComptroller() {
        if (address(comptroller) != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        _;
    }
```

This would mean that all overdue loans, `repayBorrowFresh` would revert when a borrower tries to repay overdue amount

## Impact

Borrower will never be able to fully repay the loan & eventually get liquidated.

## Recommendation

Consider allowing access to `UserManager::updateFrozenInfo` for both `Comptroller` & `UToken`

## Learning

This is an access control issue that an automated bot would easily have identifier. Even fuzz tests would have reverted a call. But still the best method in this case is a line-by-line manual review.

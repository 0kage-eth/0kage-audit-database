## Issue

Liquidation is calculated based on following condition:

```
((borrowsValue - collateralValue) / underlyingValue) >= underlyingLiqThreshold
```

Note that if for some reason, `underlyingValue` is underestimated, the RHS increases and there is a likelihood that it shoots beyond the liquidation threshold. That is exactly what happens in this case where `underlyingValue` only increases based on amount deposited & does not account for the inrterest accruing on that underlying.

## Impact

Potential premature liquidation of borrower because the underlying value is under-estimated. While deposit value might breach the liquidation threshold, deposit value plus accrued interest might still be lower than liquidation threshold.

## Recommendation

Value of the underlying assets should be derived from the vault shares and value, rather than being stored directly.

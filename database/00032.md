## Protocol

Mochi

## Issue

`FeelPoolV0::distributeMochi` does 2 actions -> `FeelPoolV0::_buyMochi` and `FeelPoolV0::_shareMochi`. This being an external function with no access control-> anyone can call this function to `buyMochi` and exchange `mochiShare` for `mochi`

```solidity
    function distributeMochi() external {
        // buy Mochi with mochiShare
        _buyMochi();
        _shareMochi();
    }
```

In `_buyMochi` the minimum output is hardcoded to `1`. This can lead a malicious user to use a flashloan to borrow mochi shares to first buy mochi, execute `distributeMochi` so that more mochi can be bought & then sell mochi at a higher price to instantly pocket arbitrage.

```solidity
   function _buyMochi() internal {
        IUSDM usdm = engine.usdm();
        address[] memory path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = address(usdm);
        path[1] = address(engine.mochi());
        usdm.approve(address(uniswapRouter), mochiShare);
        uniswapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
            mochiShare,
            1, //@audit min output is hardcoded leading to a high slippage
            path,
            address(this),
            type(uint256).max
        );
    }
```

## Impact

The pool will always buy mochi at a higher price than usual. This causes a high slippage and will lead to direct loss to protocol

## Recommendation

Calculate a min expected `mochi` and pass that as min output while executing the swap. This prevents excess slippage

## Learning

Here devs explicitly commented that they fear arbitrage attacks and yet have not introduced slippage checks. This omission is strange to explain -> but a key lesson for us is to always check if the swap has any kind of slippage protection. In this case, min price was hardcoded to 1.

GMX

## Issue

`liquidation` logic currently implemented does NOT involve token transfers -> where as repayment always involves a token transfer. So if a collateral token, say `USDC` pauses token transfers for whatever reason, while liquidations are active, users cannot close out positions.

Reason here is that collateral tokens are held in the same contract where `liquidation` is called -> so when this is happening, only accounting entries are being incremented/decremented. No token inflows/outflows are happening. This means, users can trigger liquidations even when underlying transfers are blocked

## Impact

Users can get liquidated without a mitigation mechanism.

## Recommendation

When collateral token is paused, there should be a provision to pause liquidations as well.

## Learning

Look for same inconsistency -> can we reach a state where repayments are blocked but liquidations can go through. Analyzing this scenario in all edge cases is key for catching this class of errors.

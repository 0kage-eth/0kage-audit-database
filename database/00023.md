Cooler

## Issue

Lender has a provision to allow a borrower a roll-over. However, once enabled, there is no way for a lender to stop infinite roll-over for a borrower. Since cooler allows lenders/borrowers to agree on a rate of borrowing, assuming a lender chose to lend at a low rate initially & allowed for a roll-over, a lender will be stuck until the end of time & has no recourse if a borrower simply rolls over existing loan.

As long as borrower is willing to pay interest upfront, she can rollover by calling `roll` as many times, extending duration of loan

```
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.roll()   #1

129        function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
130            Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
131            Request memory req = loan.request;
132
133            if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry)
134                revert Default();
135
136            if (!loan.rollable)
137                revert NotRollable();
138
139            uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
140            uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
141
142            loan.amount += newDebt;
143            loan.expiry += req.duration; //@audit note that lender has no way to stop extension of loan duration
144            loan.collateral += newCollateral;
145
146            collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
147:       }
```

Although there is a function called `toggleRoll`, it can't be used to stop rolls if the rolling is done in a single transaction.

## Impact

Lenders will never get access to lent funds - as good as default

## Recommendation

Have a variable called `maximumRolls` and make sure the number of rolls does not exceed this number

## Learning

This is a very specific error -> if there exists a roll-over, check for conditions that can cause a roll-over & also check if roll-over decision is unilateral and exclusively taken by a borrower or there is some lender control. Since lender is the one who owns the funds, a lender should have a say in deciding the term of lending.

## Issue

`swapEntireBalance` takes the `buy_amt_min` that is the minimum output to be received by the user,ie. minimum tokens a user should receive for a swap. But this input is not passed to the `swap` function. This would mean that user supplied minimum value is not considered while swap & swap realized conversion might be worse than the minimum value

```solidity
    function swapEntireBalance(
        uint256 buy_amt_min,
        address[] calldata route, // First address is what is being payed, Last address is what is being bought
        uint256 expectedMarketFeeBPS
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        //swaps msg.sender entire balance in the trade
        uint256 maxAmount = ERC20(route[0]).balanceOf(msg.sender);
        ERC20(route[0]).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            maxAmount // Account for expected fee
        );
        return
            _swap(
                maxAmount,
                maxAmount.sub(buy_amt_min.mul(expectedMarketFeeBPS).div(10000)), //account for fee //@audit this gives a different min output amount
                route,
                expectedMarketFeeBPS,
                msg.sender
            );
    }
```

In the above case, in the second parameter of `_swap`, instead of using `buy_amt_min`, swap function uses `maxAmount.sub(buy_amt_min.mul(expectedMarketFeeBPS).div(10000)))`.

Lets use an example

```
    max Amount = 100
    buy_amt_min = 98
    expectedMarketFeeBPS = 500
    maxAmount.sub(buy_amt_min.mul(expectedMarketFeeBPS).div(10000)) =
    100- 98*500/10000 = 95.1
```

Note that, although user supplied a minimum buy as 98, his realized price was 95. This can cause a direct loss to user

## Impact

If swap can get executed below the minimum price entered by user, it resyults in a direct loss

## Recommendation

Pass `buy_amt_min` directly to `_swap()`

## Learning

Note that, in this case, devs clearly did not understand the implications of the min_buy_amount. It is possible that at a given market fees, the calculated value turns out to be higher than `min_buy_amount`. But at a higher fee levels, the calculated value is much lower than `min_buy_amount`.

When a swap is called, it is important to analyze from a user perspective - if there is no provision to enter `min output` or if protocol is somehow not passing `min output` to swap, it can cause losses to user. In this case, it was the latter

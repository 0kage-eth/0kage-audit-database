## Protocol

Papr

## Issue

Issue here is that maxLTV and liquidation LTV are the same. A borrower taking a loan equal to max LTV stands a risk of immediate liquidation even with a small price movement. Lack of buffer between maxLTV and liquidation LTV leaves no room for a borrower to adjust his borrowing/ repay partial amount to prevent liquidation. Since liquidation includes a fee and penalty that is incurred by borrower, such a design is unfair to borrowers who have borrowed till max permissible limit

## Impact

A borrower gets liquidated early, even when loan is perfectly healthy. Since borrower has to pay liquidation fees, this is a direct loss to borrower

```
// @audit -> this logic checks liquidation
// startLiquidationAuction in PaprController
   //@audit -> note that _maxDebt is called while increasing debt
   if (info.debt < _maxDebt(oraclePrice * info.count, cachedTarget)) {
            revert IPaprController.NotLiquidatable();
        }

// @audit -> this logic allows borrowers to increase their borrowing
// _increaseDebt in PaprController

 function _increaseDebt(
        address account,
        ERC721 asset,
        address mintTo,
        uint256 amount,
        ReservoirOracleUnderwriter.OracleInfo memory oracleInfo
    ) internal {
        uint256 cachedTarget = updateTarget();

        uint256 newDebt = _vaultInfo[account][asset].debt + amount;
        uint256 oraclePrice =
            underwritePriceForCollateral(asset, ReservoirOracleUnderwriter.PriceKind.LOWER, oracleInfo);

        uint256 max = _maxDebt(_vaultInfo[account][asset].count * oraclePrice, cachedTarget);
        //@audit -> note that max here is calculated using _maxDebt
        if (newDebt > max) revert IPaprController.ExceedsMaxDebt(newDebt, max);
    }

```

## Recommendation

Keep a buffer between the maxLTV and liquidation LTV to allow for borrower to make adjustments.

## Issue

Notice that the liquidate function calculates the share of collateral to be liquidated by computing the proportion of new share to old share of the debt position. The key flaw here is that the same collateral is backing multiple debt poisitions. By calculating the % of liquidation using only 1 debt position, liquidator can take control of entire collateral by fully paying out a partial position (`share` == `old share` on 100% payment ).

```
function liquidate(uint256 positionId, address debtToken, uint256 amountCall)
    external override lock poke(debtToken) {
    // checks
    if (amountCall == 0) revert ZERO_AMOUNT();
    if (!isLiquidatable(positionId)) revert NOT_LIQUIDATABLE(positionId);

    // @audit get position to be re-paid by liquidator, however
    // borrower may have multiple debt positions
    Position storage pos = positions[positionId];
    Bank memory bank = banks[pos.underlyingToken];
    if (pos.collToken == address(0)) revert BAD_COLLATERAL(positionId);

    // @audit oldShare & share proportion of the one position being liquidated
    uint256 oldShare = pos.debtShareOf[debtToken];
    (uint256 amountPaid, uint256 share) = repayInternal(
        positionId,
        debtToken,
        amountCall
    );

    // @audit collateral shares to be given to liquidator calculated using
    // share / oldShare which only correspond to the one position being liquidated,
    // not to the total debt of the borrower (which can be in multiple positions)
    uint256 liqSize = (pos.collateralSize * share) / oldShare;
    uint256 uTokenSize = (pos.underlyingAmount * share) / oldShare;
    uint256 uVaultShare = (pos.underlyingVaultShare * share) / oldShare;

    // @audit if the borrower has multiple debt positions, the liquidator
    // can take the whole collateral by paying off only the lowest value
    // debt position, since the shares are calculcated only from the one
    // position being liquidated, not from the total debt which can be
    // spread out across multiple positions

```

A liquidator can choose smallest debt position & just make a full repayment. Liquidator gets control of full collateral and fraction of a price

## Impact

Lenders will lose out on repayment from liquidators

## Recommendation

Calculation should take into account all positions while computing old/new share.

## Learning

When checking liquidation function, it is important to consider how a liquidator gets hold of underlying collateral and carefully track how share of liquidation is calculated. Most money market platforms prefer partial liquidations only to the extent that borrowers health factor gets back >1. This makes partial liquidation calculations even more critical.

## Protocol

Astaria

## Issue

Astaria allows borrowers to hold multiple liens. A payment made by borrower towards multiple liens is all consumed by first lien. This would mean that borrowers liability still exists even after making complete payment

When a borrower makes payment towards multiple active liens using `makePayment (uint256 collateralId, uint256 paymentAmount)`, underlying `_makePayment()` loops over each lien to payoff more than one lien using the capital available.

Entire `totalCapitalAvailable` is provided in the call to `_payment()` for the first lien. This transfers all the tokens to the payee even if exceeds the `lien.amount`. Function returns the `capitalSpent` which in this case returns the entire amount sent & hence payment amount for next lien becomes 0.

## Impact

Borrower will lose out his repayment without appropriate reduction in liabilities. Partial offset to his liabilities would mean that collateral would be stuck in the contract

## Recommendation

Add paymentAmount -= lien.amount in the else block of `_payment()`

## Learning

This would have been caught by invariants -> if user has N liens totaling $M, and if repayment of $N is made where $M > $N, then total outstanding across all liens should ne $M-$N. This could have caught this issue in invariants test

When system supports multiple loans that can be repaid in one txn, always check - order in which loans are repaid, and why such order exists - if the sum total of repaid is euqal to the reduction in liabilities - if not, then there is an accounting inconsistency

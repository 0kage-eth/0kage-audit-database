Origin Dollar

## Issue

`VaultCore::allocate` function does 2 operations

    - harvests reward tokens and swaps them on Uniswap in exchange for USDT, using WETH as an intermediary
    - calls `BuyBack::swap` function which swaps all `OUSD` on uniswap in exchange for OGN token

In both cases above, protocol uses the `UniswapV2Router02::swapExactTokensForToken` contract where it sets the minimun number of tokens to receive as 0. This makes these 2 txns vulnerable to price manipulation -> users do not get any slippage protection and will be exposed to sandwich attacks

## Impact

while swapping at 2 different places, one rewards and one OUSD, minimum receive amount is set to 0 -> implies zero slippage protection. Sandwich attack on pool would mean that realized price of users could be much worse than market price

## Recommendation

Consider passing a minimum amount for execution of swap

## Learning

Concept here is the same -> when you are exchanging one asset from another via a pool that is accessible to others, there is every chance that other users can execute a sandwich attack on you if you don't mention a minimum execution price

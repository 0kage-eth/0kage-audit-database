## Issue

LinesOfCredit array holds a list of IDs (`ids`) that a borrower can borrow against. Interactions withe this array are highly dependent on the first element of the array (`id[0]`), which is assumed to be the oldest credit line with non zero principal. For eg., borrowers must first repay credit line 0, before moving to the next line.

`whileBorrowing` modifier assumes that if first element has no principal, borrower is not borrowing. This implicit assumption can be exploited and a borrower can maliciously force the first element principal ==0 and hence corrupt the logic that uses this modifier.

Notably, this modifier is used in critical functions such as `liquidate` - modifier always reverts, effectively disabling liquidation

```solidity

modifier whileBorrowing() {
    if(count == 0 || credits[ids[0]].principal == 0) { revert NotBorrowing(); }
    _;
}
```

By following a sequence of steps, borrower can make the condition `credits[ids[0]].principal == 0` and thus revert the `whileBorrowing` modifiers

## Impact

Critical functions such as liquidate get disabled because of the above error.

```
    function depositAndClose()
        external
        payable
        override
        whileBorrowing //@audit -> this reverts
        onlyBorrower
        returns (bool)
        {
        }
```

```
    function depositAndRepay(uint256 amount)
        external
        payable
        override
        whileBorrowing //@audit -> this reverts
        returns (bool)
    {
    }
```

## Key Learning

When conditions use hard coded elements in an array, always look for ways to modify the hardcoded elements and hence corrupt the logic. This typically happens when devs make assumption - atleast one element always exists (reference 0'th element)' - size is atleast `n` elements - ascending/descending order of the array

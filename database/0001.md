## Issue

A loan is liquidatable when time since last repaid timestamp is greater than payment default duration. This calculation ignores the payment cycle duration -> incases when payment cycle duration is higher than payment default duration, there is a single bullet payment. Ignoring payment cycle duration makes the logic conclude wrongly that loan has defaulted and hence is liquidatable -> this leads to a direct loss to borrower.

## Impact

A borrower gets liquidated early, even when loan is perfectly healthy. Since borrower has to pay liquidation fees, this is a direct loss to borrower

## Code

A simplified version of code is below

```
solidity

function lastRepaidTimestamp(Loan storage loan) internal view returns (uint32) {
    return
        // @audit if no repayments have yet been made, lastRepaidTimestamp()
        // will return acceptedTimestamp - time when loan was accepted
        loan.lastRepaidTimestamp == 0
            ? loan.acceptedTimestamp
            : loan.lastRepaidTimestamp;
}

function canLiquidateLoan(uint loanId) public returns (bool) {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanId];

    // Make sure loan cannot be liquidated if it is not active
    if (loan.state != LoanState.ACCEPTED) return false;

    return (uint32(block.timestamp) - lastRepaidTimestamp(loan) > paymentDefaultDuration);
    // @audit if no repayments have been made:
    // block.timestamp - acceptedTimestamp > paymentDefaultDuration
    // doesn't check paymentCycleDuration (when next payment is due)
    // if paymentDefaultDuration < paymentCycleDuration, can be liquidated
    // *before* first payment is due. If paymentDefaultDuration is very small,
    // can be liquidated very soon after taking loan, way before first payment
    // is due!
}

```

## Recommendation

The `canLiquidateLoan` should check for payment cycle duration. Only on completion of atleast one payment cycle should this logic be applicable.

## Protocol

Union finance

## Issue

This protocol has a unique mechanism:

In this system a staker stakes and vouches for a borrower. Borrower can then go and take a new loan -> borrower information, specifically `accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay` is updated with current block number. Staker can then write off the debt of a borrower -> during writeoff, the principal is reset to 0 but the `lastRepay` is not updated. And this is the source of vulnerability

When staker again vouches for same borrower in future & that borrower again borrows, the `lastRepay` is not updated correctly. As a result, there is a likelihood that below condition gets passed & any user can now write-off the debt

```
solidity
//UserManager: debtWriteoff Line 738

        // This function is only callable by the public if the loan is overdue by
        // overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks. This stops the system being left with
        // debt that is overdue indefinitely and no ability to do anything about it.
        if (block.number <= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks) {
            if (staker != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        }

```

## Impact

Staker loses the staked amount prematurely. In this model, since stakers vouch for a borrower, a malicious borrower can take a loan and get it written off, causing a loss to the staker

## Recommendation

In the `debtWriteoff` when principal is being reduced to 0, we need to ensure that `lastRepay` is also reset to 0.
